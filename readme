akaris-ng is a from scratch rewrite of the akaris kernel. It is nowhere
near complete, and it doesn't do much.

The build system requires BSD make.  To build a specific target, change
to the target's compile directory and build the kernel target:

cd sys/i686/compile
make kernel.k

or for tests:

cd sys/test/compile
make kernel

If you built an i686 kernel, you can create a floppy disk with grub on
it by going into disk/ and typing

make linux # Build local.img on linux machines
make openbsd # Build local.img on openbsd machines

qemu -fda local.img  #Run qemu
