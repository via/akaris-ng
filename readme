akaris-ng is a from scratch rewrite of the akaris kernel. It is nowhere
near complete, and it doesn't do much.

Build requires scons.  By default, it will try to build the i686 target,
which can be specifically requested by doing

scons arch=i686

It will expect a usable i686-elf-* toolchain in PATH.

To build a hosted debug executive, use

scons arch=test

and it will build sys/kernel, which should run tests on your hosted 
platform.

If you built an i686 kernel, you can create a floppy disk with grub on
it by going into disk/ and typing

make linux # Build local.img on linux machines
make openbsd # Build local.img on openbsd machines

qemu -fda local.img  #Run qemu
