akaris-ng is a from scratch rewrite of the akaris kernel. It is nowhere
near complete, and it doesn't do much.

Build requires scons.  By default, it will try to build the i686 target,
which can be specifically requested by doing

scons arch=i686

It will expect a usable i686-elf-* toolchain in PATH.

To build a hosted debug executive, use

scons arch=test

and it will build sys/kernel, which should run tests on your hosted 
platform.
